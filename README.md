CSS3, short for Cascading Style Sheets 3, is the latest version of the CSS specification used for styling and presenting the visual aspects of web pages. It introduces several new features and enhancements compared to its predecessor, CSS2.

<i>Some key features and capabilities of CSS3 include:

1. Selectors: CSS3 introduces new and more powerful selectors, allowing developers to target specific elements based on various criteria. These include attribute selectors, structural pseudo-classes, and advanced selectors like :nth-child and :not, which provide more flexibility and precision in selecting elements.

2. Box model enhancements: CSS3 introduces new properties and values for the box model, which defines how elements are laid out and sized on the page. These enhancements include the ability to control box sizing with the box-sizing property, rounded corners with border-radius, and box shadows with box-shadow.

3. Flexible layout: CSS3 introduces flexible box layout, also known as Flexbox, which provides a flexible and responsive way to arrange and align elements within a container. Flexbox allows developers to create complex and dynamic layouts with ease, enabling more adaptive and responsive designs.

4. Responsive design: CSS3 includes media queries, which allow developers to apply different styles based on the characteristics of the device or viewport. This enables the creation of responsive designs that can adapt and optimize the layout and appearance for different screen sizes and devices.

5. Transitions and animations: CSS3 introduces the transition and animation properties, which enable smooth transitions and animations of CSS properties. With CSS3 animations, developers can create visually appealing effects such as fade-ins, slide-outs, and keyframe animations without relying on JavaScript or external libraries.

6. Typography and text effects: CSS3 introduces new properties and values for controlling typography and text effects. This includes features like web fonts, text shadows, text gradients, and multi-column layouts, allowing for more creative and visually engaging text presentations.

7. 2D/3D transformations: CSS3 provides the ability to apply 2D and 3D transformations to elements, allowing for rotation, scaling, skewing, and perspective effects. These transformations can be combined with transitions and animations to create interactive and visually dynamic elements.

8. Backgrounds and gradients: CSS3 introduces new options for styling backgrounds, including gradients, multiple backgrounds, and background-size control. Gradients enable the creation of smooth color transitions, while multiple backgrounds allow for layered and complex background designs.</i>
